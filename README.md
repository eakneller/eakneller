### 

I am a highly skilled computational geoscientist with expertise in geodynamics, basin analysis
and energy exploration. My primary scientific interests include the application of computational 
fluid dynamics to model non-linear visco-elasto plastic multiphase deformation in terrestrial 
planets, reconstructing the evolution of ancient geological systems and developing 
multidisciplinary computational approaches for evaluating the distribution of energy resources.
 With over 15 years of experience in developing high-performance applications using Python and C++, 
I have successfully led the development and application of multiple globally deployed computational 
tools used for scientific research and business decisions analysis in the energy industry. 
Additionally, I have interests in utilizing Numba and Julia for rapid high-performance prototype 
development and the development of easy to extend and maintain 
scientific software.
