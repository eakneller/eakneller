### 

I am a highly skilled computational geoscientist with expertise in geodynamics, basin analysis
and energy exploration. My primary scientific interests include the application of computational 
fluid dynamics to model visco-elasto plastic multiphase deformation in terrestrial 
planets, reconstructing the tectonic, stratigraphic and thermal history of sedimentary 
basins and developing multidisciplinary approaches for assessing the distribution and economic 
value of energy resources. With over 15 years of experience in developing high-performance 
applications using Python, C++ and Julia, I have successfully led the development and application 
of multiple globally deployed computational tools used for scientific research and business 
decisions analysis in the energy industry.
